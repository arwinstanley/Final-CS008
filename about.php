        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Our main goal is to get sea otters off of the Endangered Species List, and you can help us complete this goal. There are three subspecies of sea otters: The Southern Sea Otter, Northern Sea Otter, and Russian Sea Otter. As of right now, two of those subspecies, the Southern Sea Otters and the Northern Sea Otters are on the Endangered Species Act as “threatened”. But with your help, hopefully one day we can remove all the species from the Endangered List for good.

            Do you want to defend these innocent creatures? Show your support for saving the lives of sea otters and helping the environment by adopting an animal.
With each adoption we are enabled to further educate more people about the absolute necessity to keeping sea otters off the endangered species list.

            At one point in time, decades before now, there were millions of sea otters filling our seas and doing their part to keep the ecosystem healthy. As time went on, humans stopped seeing these animals as a means to keep our environment intact and instead as a means to increase their economic standing. They began being killed for their fur, and while they are protected today from such reckless killing, there are still those choose to take their lives. Not only this, but they face many other threats to their life.
With each adoption, you are supporting the efforts to protect sea otters from the many threats they face.
