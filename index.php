        <h2>What is a Sea Otter?</h2>
        <p>
            Sea otters, arguably one of the cutest and seemingly ‘cuddliest’ mammals on Earth, are more than just a means to say “aww” and smile. These creatures have purpose in our environment, and if they were to ever go extinct, our environment will certainly feel the impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sea otters used to be seen in huge numbers. The world population of these creatures was once more than one million, but overtime as human greed and neglect for our environment increased, this number has plummeted to a sad 106,000 worldwide, and humans can certainly be held responsible for this decline.
        </p>

        <h2>Threats to Sea Otters</h2>

        <p>
            Offshore drilling and shipping cause oil spills in our oceans which threaten the populations of sea otters immensely. How would you feel if someone came into your home and started pouring oil everywhere which would eventually lead to your death? This is one way to put yourself in the webbed feet of sea otters. When oil spills into the ocean, a sea otters’ natural habitat, it causes their fur to mat which keeps their bodies from being insulated. This makes them vulnerable to the freezing temperatures of the water which causes these poor creatures to come down with hypothermia and meet their deaths. Not only can these oil spills cause these innocent mammals to literally freeze to death but can also cause liver and kidney failure and damage to their lungs and eyes because of how toxic it is. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1989, an oil tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Company (BOOO) called the Exxon Valdez struck a reef and spilled 10.8 million US gallons of oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound. This killed thousands and thousands of innocent sea otters. This kind of threat continues to be a problem as more and more countries continue to drill for oil and ship it through the area where sea otters inhabit. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Humans can also be held responsible for the death of sea otters through entrapping them in fishing traps and nets. While this may not seem intentional, since sea otters eat the same kind of shellfish that humans eat, they become viewed as competition by shell fishers who have then decided to use fishing gear that can intentionally cause sea otters to get entangled in, drown, and die. The most direct way humans are killing sea otters are simply by shooting them and skinning them for their fur. Since sea otters have the softest and densest fur in the entire animal kingdom, coats made from their hide sell for thousands of dollars. To give you an idea of how dense their fur is, the average hairs per square inch on a human head is 700, while the average hairs per square inch on a sea otter is 170,000 to over 1 million. This makes their fur extremely desirable for a fashionable coat, but it does not in any way make it right to take life away from an innocent animal merely to make a profit. 
        </p>

        <p>
            There is another domino effect that kills sea otters that has been set off by humans. Since fisherman are constantly fishing for food such as sea urchins, lobster, and crab, some of the main food that sea otters must eat to survive, these sea otters are being driven out of their range in the sea to the edges of their habitat due to the lack of food where hungry sharks eagerly await. Because of this, sea otters that have been killed by sharks account for more than half of the dead animals found.

            Sea otters are one of the keys to keeping a healthy kelp forest ecosystem. Sea otters feed on sea urchins, and sea urchins clean up any kelp that as fallen to the sea floor. Since sea otters feed on sea urchins, they are keeping this population balanced which is crucial to maintaining a healthy kelp forest ecosystem. Without sea otters, sea urchins and the other invertebrates that sea otters feed on would destroy kelp forests which would in turn cause other species that depend on kelp forests to survive, for example fish use these kelp forests to hide from predators and many other species eat kelp to survive. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Kelp forests also protect us humans! These forests protect our coastlines from storm surge as well as absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which can be very harmful to us. Sea otters going extinct is a horrible domino effect that would have many negative ramifications on our Earth.
